Populations of puma *Puma concolor* a native feline from the Americas are suffering from genomic inbreeding and small population sizes. Humans have reduced their habitats and isolated the populations. Particularly, a population in Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida was very affected. In 1995, eight pumas from Texas were introduced to the population with the purpose of genomic rescue. I am interesed in understanding how successful the rescue was. Is the local genetic diversity from Big Cypress preserved? Is selection helping preserve variation from a specific ancestry in different parts of the genome?
