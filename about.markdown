I am a PhD Candidate in the [Computational Biology Program](https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/) at UC Berkeley. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Genomic Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I am working under the supervision of [Rasmus Nielsen](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/research/). My main projects are about the genetic basis and evolution of color polymorphism. I am particularly working with the toad-headed lizard (*Phrynocephalus versicolor*) from China and the strawberry poison frog (*Oophaga pumilio*) from Panama.

#### Where have I been?
I am from Mexico City, I was born and raised there. Spanish is my Native Language. I would spend many of my childhood weekends in Puebla, the state where my mother's family lived. Puebla has a special place in my heart and not only because the food there is awesome. I studied my undergrad for three years in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and one year in Munich, Germany. After Munich, I moved straight to Berkeley to start my Ph.D. and I am still here.

California has exceeded my expectations and I have loved being here, especially for its National Parks. I like living in a place where I am not the only Mexican and find ingredients for cooking my food. Most importanlty I love many of the people that I have met here.
