#### Ongoing research

##### *Phrynochephalus versicolor* 

I do populations genetics of *Phrynochephalus versicolor* a lizard from the Gobi Desert (China and Mongolia). This lizard has different populations that vary in how much pigment they have in their skin. Most of the populations have light brown/yellow skin, same color as the sand they live in. There is a population that is black, matching the black sand of the region where it lives. I study the genetic basis of this adaptation.
