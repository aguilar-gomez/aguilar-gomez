#### Ongoing research

**Lizard genetics**

I do populations genetics of the multicolor toad-headed lizard (*Phrynochephalus versicolor*) a lizard from China and Mongolia. This lizard has different populations that vary in how much pigment they have in their skin. Most of the populations have light brown/yellow skin, same color as the sand they live in. There is a population that is black, matching the black sand of the region where it lives. I study the genetic basis of this adaptation. 



**Strawberry poision frog genomics**

*Oophaga pumilio* is the scientific name of this frog. *Oophaga* comes from the greek *phagos* (eat) and *oon* (egg), this type of frog feeds their tadpoles with unfertilized eggs, hence the name. *Pumilio* comes from pigmy/dwarf in greek, which is very descriptive, this frog fits in the tip of one of my fingers. *O. pumilio* is usually red, no wonder it was named "strawberry". However there is an archipelago in Panama called Bocas del Toro where there is a lot of variation. There are several island and almost each one of them has their own color of frog (yellow, green, orange, red, blue, etc). I study their evolution and population history. I am trying to find the genes behind their colors. 


#### Previous research

**Microfluidics and transcriptional memory**

During my undergrad I had the opportunity to work with [Robert Schneider](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/ife/research/robert-schneider-chromatin-dynamics-and-epigenetics/research/index.html). I was working under the supervision of Poonam Bheda. We worked together on her transcriptional memory postdoc project. We induced the *GAL1* gene in yeast by adding galactose to the media where the yeast where growing. Then we repressed the expression by changing the media to glucose. A second time the galactose was added and the expression of the GAL gene was faster and higher. Using a microfuidics set up we would run experiments where we could track single cells for hours as we induced and repressed them several times. We studied the inheritance of this transcriptional memory and some mutants that would result in gain or loss os memory. Articles we published associated to this research:

1. [Microfluidics for single-cell lineage tracking over time to characterize transmission of phenotypes in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](/files/publications/2020StarProtocol.pdf)

2. [Single-Cell Tracing Dissects Regulation of Maintenance and Inheritance of Transcriptional Reinduction Memory](/files/publications/2020Microfluidics.pdf)
