I am trying to write the description of my research in very accesible terms. Please let me know if it is hard to understand. Trying to avoid terms like *polymorphism*, *melanic*, etc.

#### Ongoing research

**Lizard genetics**

I do populations genetics of the multicolor toad-headed lizard (*Phrynochephalus versicolor*) a lizard from China and Mongolia. This lizard has different populations that vary in how much pigment they have in their skin. Most of the populations have light brown/yellow skin, same color as the sand they live in. There is a population that is black, matching the black sand of the region where it lives. I study the genetic basis of this adaptation.

**Starwberry poision frog genomics**

*Oophaga pumilio* is the scientific name of this frog. *Oophaga* comes from the greek *phagos* (eat) and *oon* (egg), this type of frog feeds their tadpoles with unfertilized eggs, hence the name. *Pumilio* comes from pigmy/dwarf in greek, which is very descriptive, this frog fits in the tip of one of my fingers. *O. pumilio* is usually red, no wonder it was named "strawberry". However there is an archipelago in Panama called Bocas del Toro where there is a lot of variation. There are several island and almost each one of them has their own color of frog (yellow, green, orange, red, blue, etc). I study the evolution, population history and genetic basis of this populations and their colors.
