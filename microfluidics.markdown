During my undergrad I had the opportunity to work with [Robert Schneider](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/ife/research-groups/schneider-lab). I was working under the supervision of Poonam Bheda. We worked together on her transcriptional memory postdoc project. We induced the *GAL1* gene in yeast by adding galactose to the media where the yeast where growing. Then we repressed the expression by changing the media to glucose. A second time the galactose was added and the expression of the *GAL1* gene was faster and higher. Using a microfuidics set up we would run experiments where we could track single cells for hours as we induced and repressed them several times. We studied the inheritance of this transcriptional memory and some mutants that would result in gain or loss os memory. Articles we published associated to this research:

- [Microfluidics for single-cell lineage tracking over time to characterize transmission of phenotypes in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](/files/publications/2020StarProtocol.pdf)
