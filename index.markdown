[Here is the most updated version of my CV](/files/CVDianaAguilarGomez.pdf).

<img src="/figures/DianaLA.jpg" style="float:right;padding-right:25px;width:350px">
I am a [Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.chicano.ucla.edu/research/hsi-ucla-chancellors-postdoctoral-fellows) at UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. I am working with [Kirk Lohmueller](https://lohmueller.eeb.ucla.edu/) in several conservation genomics projects. 
  1. Modeling TEs in populations of concern applied to Channel Island foxes
  2. Assesing survival of the Rice’s whale
  3. Evaluating the genomic rescue in Florida Panthers

I got my [Computational Biology PhD](https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/) at UC Berkeley,under the supervision of [Rasmus Nielsen](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/research/). I have a bachelor’s degree in Genomic Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). My main research interests are adaptation and conservation genomics. 

For my PhD, my first two chapters were about the genetic basis and evolution of color polymorphism. I worked with the toad-headed lizard (*Phrynocephalus versicolor*) from China and the strawberry poison frog (*Oophaga pumilio*) from Central America. My third chapter is about adaptation to free diving in the Haenyeo population from Jeju, Korea.
