I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. I am working with [Kirk Lohmueller](https://lohmueller.eeb.ucla.edu/) modeling SVs and TEs in populations of concern.

I got my [Computational Biology PhD](https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/) at UC Berkeley,under the supervision of [Rasmus Nielsen](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/research/). I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Genomic Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). My main research interests are adaptation and conservation genomics. 

For my PhD, my first two chapters are about the genetic basis and evolution of color polymorphism. I am particularly working with the toad-headed lizard (*Phrynocephalus versicolor*) from China and the strawberry poison frog (*Oophaga pumilio*) from Panama. My third chapter is about adaptation to free diving in the Haenyeo population. For my fourth chapter In am trying to understand how selection is acting on genetically rescued genomes of the Florida Panthers (*Puma concolor*).

[Here is the most updated version of my CV](/files/CVDianaAguilarGomez.pdf).

#### Where have I been?
I am from Mexico City, I was born and raised there. Spanish is my Native Language. My childhood weekends were spent in Puebla, the state where my mother's family is originary. Puebla has a special place in my heart and not only because the food there is awesome. I studied my undergrad for three years in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and one year in Munich, Germany. After Munich, I moved straight to Berkeley to start my Ph.D. I lived in California since 2017.
